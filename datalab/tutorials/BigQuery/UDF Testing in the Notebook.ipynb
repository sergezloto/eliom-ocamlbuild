    "## Creating and Testing the UDF\n",
    "\n",
    "UDFs are Javascript functions that take a row object and emitter function as input; they perform some computation and then call the emitter function to output a result row object. We will first write and test our UDF as Javascript. We can use a %%javascript cell for this. We will write the code of the UDF (and its helper function `getParameters`), then define some test data, and finally call the UDF with the test data after creating a mock version of the emitter function. Note that in a %%javascript cell you can access the output area element with the name `element`; our mock emitter will use that to produce output we can see in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no state shared between %%javascript cells so we have to do this all in a single cell."
