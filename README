Hi there!

You guessed it: this is an ocamlbuild[1] plugin file that enables correct builds
of Eliom[2] multi-source projects.
The important bit in the repo is the myocamlbuild.ml OCaml source file.
Sample Makefile and sources show how to use the plugin.

Limitations:
- if the server part and the client part are made up of different modules, the modules must be referenced in
  different `mllib` files as in this skeleton (`server.mllib` and `client.mllib`, resp.)
  The application name must match the `.js` filename as usual.
- the client and server side build subdirectories are hard-coded to `_build/_server` and
  `_build/_client`, respectively.
- `eliomdep`, `eliomc`, `js_of_eliom` must exist on the search path ($PATH).
- The user and group in the ocsigen configuration file are hard-coded to serge, staff.
  Change them to your liking before use.
- The persistence backend is set up as `sqlite` in the ocsigen configuration file.
  Change to `dbm` if desired.
